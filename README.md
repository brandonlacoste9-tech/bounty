# 🐺 CYBERHOUND // BOUNTY BOARD
> *The Mercenary Network for High-Value Contracts.*

**Cyberhound** is a decentralized "reverse marketplace" for technical talent. Instead of hunting for jobs on traditional boards, elite developers and operatives access a curated feed of "Bounties" (Contracts) scraped from across the remote web.

---

## 📡 THE MISSION
Companies are tired of hiring friction. Developers are tired of noise.
**Cyberhound** solves this by treating contracts like **Bounties**:
1.  **High Stakes:** We filter for high-value remote roles.
2.  **Gamified:** Jobs are ranked by Difficulty (NOVICE, VETERAN, LETHAL).
3.  **Fast Action:** Direct links to apply/bid. No "create an account" friction.
